# 📱 Smart SMS Transaction Analysis Feature

## 🎯 Overview

The Smart Expense Tracker app now includes **automatic transaction detection** from SMS messages. Users simply tap "Analyze Transactions" and the app intelligently extracts transaction details from bank alerts, UPI notifications, and payment confirmations.

## 🔍 How It Works

### 1. **No Manual Input Required**
- Users tap the **"Analyze Transactions"** button
- App automatically reads SMS messages from the last 30 days
- Processes bank/UPI alerts in the background

### 2. **Smart Data Extraction**
The system automatically extracts:
- 💰 **Amount**: Recognizes various formats (₹1,234.56, Rs.1234, INR 1000)
- 📅 **Date**: Uses SMS timestamp for accurate transaction dating
- 🏪 **Merchant/Description**: Identifies payee from SMS content
- 🏛️ **Source**: Detects bank/payment service (SBI, HDFC, Paytm, GPay, etc.)

### 3. **Intelligent Categorization**
Transactions are automatically categorized using AI-powered pattern matching:
