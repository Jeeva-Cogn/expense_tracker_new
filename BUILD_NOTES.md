# Build Notes for Expense Tracker

## Recent Build Issue Fix

### Problem
The build was failing due to namespace configuration issues with the `sms_advanced` plugin:

```
Namespace not specified. Specify a namespace in the module's build file.
```

### Solution Applied
1. **Replaced SMS Package**: Temporarily disabled SMS functionality by removing the `sms_advanced` package
2. **Mock Implementation**: Created a mock SMS reader that returns empty results
3. **Future Enhancement**: SMS functionality can be re-enabled once a compatible package is found

### Current Status
- ✅ Build errors resolved
- ✅ All other features working (Budget tracking, AI analysis, Dashboard, etc.)
- ⚠️ SMS parsing temporarily disabled (returns empty results)

### SMS Package Options for Future Implementation
1. `telephony` - Modern but might have build issues
2. `flutter_sms_inbox` - Lightweight option
3. `sms_maintained` - Maintained fork but lacks null safety
4. Custom platform channels for SMS access

### Build Requirements
- Flutter SDK 3.4.1+
- Android SDK (set ANDROID_HOME environment variable)
- Kotlin support enabled

### Next Steps
1. Find a compatible SMS package that supports:
   - Null safety
   - Modern Android Gradle Plugin
   - Proper namespace configuration
2. Re-implement SMS transaction parsing
3. Test on physical Android device with SMS permissions

## All Other Features Remain Fully Functional
- 🎯 Budget tracking and progress bars
- 📊 Interactive financial dashboard with charts
- 🤖 AI-powered expense analysis and suggestions
- 🔔 Smart notifications and reminders
- ⚙️ Comprehensive settings and theming
- 💾 Offline-first Hive database
- 🌍 Multi-platform support (Android, iOS, Web, Desktop)
